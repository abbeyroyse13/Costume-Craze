# CostumeCraze

Welcome to Costume Craze! Costume Craze is an Etsy-esque app where users can browse Halloween costumes they potentially want to buy. They can also list their own costumes for sale. The costume categories include: wigs, masks, makeup, accessories, and full costumes.  
The goal of Costume Craze is to make it easy to search for Halloween products for more reasonable prices than you would find at a typical Halloween store or site. Costume Craze is aimed at users of all ages and contains costumes for all ages. Have fun browsing and have a Happy Halloween! ðŸ‘»
